# NAGF Student Attendance Recorder

Simple C script that allows the user to record student attendance for a class.

It prompts the user to enter the current date, and then asks if each student is present or absent. It stores the attendance information in a file called "attendance.txt", and appends the new attendance data to the end of the file.

A tool designed for programming teachers. If you teach C programming and want to impress your students, give it a try!
